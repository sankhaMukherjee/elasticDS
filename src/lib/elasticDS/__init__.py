"""elasticDS library

This library is going to be used for generating packages for users
who are doing regular data science work. This will connect to a supplied
elastic search server and save the hyperparameters, and associated 
results of specific instances, which will later allow us to display things
on a Kibana dashboard. 

Getting Started
